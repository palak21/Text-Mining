# Text-Mining
"Text mining methods allow us to highlight the most frequently used keywords in a paragraph of texts. One can create a word cloud, also referred to as text cloud or tag cloud, which is a visual representation of text data."  Today, I was reading an article that introduces Text mining &amp; Word Cloud using R, and I tried to build what I learned today, actually the result was quite exciting. I used "Martin Luther King's speech" in this demo.  Speech link https://lnkd.in/d7QNKsu  You can get check the code in this repo, add start if you like it ;) https://lnkd.in/dCsnREz

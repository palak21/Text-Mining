# Text-Mining
"Text mining methods allow us to highlight the most frequently used keywords in a paragraph of texts. 
One can create a word cloud, also referred to as text cloud or tag cloud, which is a visual representation of text data."  
 I was reading an article that introduces Text mining &amp; Word Cloud using R.
 I used "Martin Luther King's speech" in this demo.
